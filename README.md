Rolling a kernel just for Dell Vostro 1000 

## Primary Issues
* Each time I need to reinstall, finding and installing the WiFi drivers without an Internet connection is the worst
* 13-year-old laptop with limited processor and RAM benefits from having as few ... resources ... as possible
* Bodhi is fast and light but has no documentation or support so confusing or glitchy features, etc. are a pain in the ass
* Can I really get rid of that Dell splash screen?!

## Questions
* How do I create the UI?
* At the most basic, what does this kernel come with and do? How would I open a terminal after first launch?
* Config the UI?
* Am I stuck with the lame old-seeming Chromium & Firefox I currently have?
